# Introduction to Programming
## Programming Languages and Organization
Programming languages help us to tell computers what to do. Computers use their own language, called machine code. Machines understand binary code, that is, 1s and 0s. To make communicating wit computers easier, we have human-readable programming languages. Two categories of programming languages are interpreted languages and compiled languages.

### Interpreted Languages
Interpreted language is also commonly referred to as scripted or scripting language. Programs written in interpreted or scripted language, like Python and HTML, run through the programming interpreter on your computer's operating system or in your web browser. The interpreter takes the human-readable scripted code and then translates it into machine code, enabling the computer to complete the requested task. As computers and webpages have changed and advanced, some interpreted languages are outdated, while some other languages are more versatile and easier to learn and thus more often used.

All interpreted languages need an interpreter to translate the source code. Translators are built into your web browser or they require a program on your computer to translate the code. 

Common interpreted languages are:

- JavaScript, a simple scripting language that runs through the web browser interpreter
- Python, a language that is popular because it is easy to learn and use for developers
- Lua, a general purpose, lighweight game scripting language that is easy to learn and use
- HTML, a markup language used for formatting web pages

### Compiled Languages
Another category of programming languages is the compiled languages. Compiled programs are applications and programs, like your music app or your operating systems, that you run on your computer or device. The programs are packaged, or compiled, into one executable file. They are usually larger programs. Compiled programs are used to solve more challenging problems, like interpreting source code.

Compiled programming languages are often referred to more simply as programming languages. A compiler program creates a program file, which runs the software. Simply put, it piles the code into one file that runs when you double-click on the app on your device. The program runs faster and it can be done repeatedly. The source code is converted from the programming language to machine code. Then it is compiled into one executable file. Finally, the program runs when you select icon or file on your device.

Examples of compiled languages are:

- C, C++ and C#, which are used in many operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, Apple's MacOS, and the open-source operating system Linux
- Java, which works well across platforms, such as AndroidOS

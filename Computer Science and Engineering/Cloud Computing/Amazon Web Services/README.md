# Amazon Web Services (AWS)
## What is the Cloud? 
In the past, companies and organizations hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers. They needed to allocate entire infrastructure departments to take care of them, resulting in a costly operation that made some workloads and experimentation impossible.

As internet usage became more widespread, the demand for compute, storage, and networking equipment increased. For some companies and organizations, the cost of maintaining a large physical presence was unsustainable. To solve this problem, cloud computing was created.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. You no longer have to manage and maintain your own hardware in your own data centers. Companies like AWS own and maintain these data centers and provide virtualized data center technologies and services to users over the internet.

To help differentiate between running workloads on-premises versus in the cloud, consider the scenario where your developers need to deploy a new feature on your application. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the exact same configurations as production.

If you run your application on-premises, creating this additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. All of these tasks can be time-consuming and take days to perform. Meanwhile, the new product feature’s time-to-market is increasing and your developers are waiting for this environment.

If you ran your application in the cloud, you can replicate the entire environment as often as needed in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, you can logically manage your physical infrastructure over the internet.

Using cloud computing not only saves you time from the set-up perspective, but it also removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting. If you look at any application, you’ll see that some of the aspects of it are very important to your business, like the code. However, there are other aspects that are no different than any other application you might make: for instance the compute the code runs on. By removing repetitive common tasks that don’t differentiate your business, like installing virtual machines, or storing backups, you can focus on what is strategically unique to your business and let AWS handle the tasks that are time consuming and don’t separate you from your competitors.

So where does AWS fit into all of this? Well AWS simply just provides cloud computing services. Those IT resources mentioned in the cloud computing definition are AWS services in this case. We’ll need to use these AWS services to architect a scalable, highly available, and cost effective infrastructure to host our corporate directory application. This way we can get our corporate directory app out into the world quickly, without having to manage any heavy-duty physical hardware. There are the six main advantages to running your workloads on AWS.

### The Six Benefits of Cloud Computing
Pay as you go. Instead of investing in data centers and hardware before you know how you are going to use them, you pay only when you use computing resources, and pay only for how much you use.

Benefit from massive economies of scale. By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

Stop guessing capacity. Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.

Increase speed and agility. IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers. Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure. This is often referred to as undifferentiated heavy lifting.

Go global in minutes. Easily deploy your application in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.

## AWS Global Infrastructure
Infrastructure, like data centers and networking connectivity, still exists as the foundation of every cloud application. In AWS, this physical infrastructure makes up the AWS Global Infrastructure, in the form of Availability Zones and Regions.

### Regions
![Amazon Regions](Amazon_Regions.png)

Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers. AWS Regions are named after the location where they reside. For example, in the United States, there is a Region in Northern Virginia called the Northern Virginia Region and a Region in Oregon called the Oregon Region. There are Regions in Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and South America, and AWS continues to expand to meet the needs of its customers.Each AWS Region is associated with a geographical name and a Region code.

Here are a few examples of Region codes:

- us-east-1: This is the first Region created in the east of the US. The geographical name for this Region is N. Virginia.
- ap-northeast-1: The first Region created in the northeast of Asia Pacific. The geographical name for this Region is Tokyo.

AWS Regions are independent from one another. This means that your data is not replicated from one Region to another, without your explicit consent and authorization.

### Choose the Right AWS Region
Consider four main aspects when deciding which AWS Region to host your applications and workloads: latency, price, service availability, and compliance.

**Latency.** If your application is sensitive to latency, choose a Region that is close to your user base. This helps prevent long wait times for your customers. Synchronous applications such as gaming, telephony, WebSockets, and IoT are significantly affected by higher latency, but even asynchronous workloads, such as ecommerce applications, can suffer from an impact on user connectivity.

**Price.** Due to the local economy and the physical nature of operating data centers, prices may vary from one Region to another. The pricing in a Region can be impacted by internet connectivity, prices of imported pieces of equipment, customs, real estate, and more. Instead of charging a flat rate worldwide, AWS charges based on the financial factors specific to the location.

**Service availability.** Some services may not be available in some Regions. The AWS documentation provides a table containing the Regions and the available services within each one.

**Data compliance.** Enterprise companies often need to comply with regulations that require customer data to be stored in a specific geographic territory. If applicable, you should choose a Region that meets your compliance requirements.

### Availability Zones (AZ)
![Region - AZ - DC (1)](Region_AZ_DC_(1).png)

Inside every Region is a cluster of Availability Zones (AZ). An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. These data centers operate in discrete facilities with undisclosed locations. They are connected using redundant high-speed and low-latency links. AZs also have a code name. Since they’re located inside Regions, they can be addressed by appending a letter to the end of the Region code name. For example:

- us-east-1a: an AZ in us-east-1 (Northern Virginia Region)
- sa-east-1b: an AZ in sa-east-1 (São Paulo Region in South America)

If you see that a resource exists in us-east-1c, you know this resource is located in AZ c of the us-east-1 Region.

### Scope AWS Services
Depending on the AWS Service you use, your resources are either deployed at the AZ, Region, or Global level. Each service is different, so you need to understand how the scope of a service may affect your application architecture. When you operate a Region-scoped service, you only need to select the Region you want to use. If you are not asked to specify an individual AZ to deploy the service in, this is an indicator that the service operates on a Region-scope level. For region-scoped services, AWS automatically performs actions to increase data durability and availability. On the other hand, some services ask you to specify an AZ. With these services, you are often responsible for increasing the data durability and high availability of these resources.

### Maintain Resiliency
To keep your application available, you need to maintain high availability and resiliency. A well-known best practice for cloud architecture is to use Region-scoped, managed services. These services come with availability and resiliency built in. When that is not possible, make sure the workload is replicated across multiple AZs. At a minimum, you should use two AZs. If one entire AZ fails, your application will have infrastructure up and running in at least a second AZ to take over the traffic.

## Interacting with AWS
Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized. In AWS, you can make API calls to services and resources through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs).

### The AWS Management Console
One way to manage cloud resources is through the web-based console, where you log in and click on the desired service. This can be the easiest way to create and manage resources when you’re first begin working with the cloud. Below is a screenshot that shows the landing page when you first log into the AWS Management Console.

The services are placed in categories, such as compute, database, storage and security, identity and compliance. On the upper right corner is the Region selector. If you click it and change the Region, you will make requests to the services in the chosen Region. The URL changes, too. Changing the Region directs the browser to make requests to a whole different AWS Region, represented by a different subdomain.

### The AWS Command Line Interface
Consider the scenario where you run tens of servers on AWS for your application’s frontend. You want to run a report to collect data from all of these servers. You need to do this programmatically every day because the server details may change. Instead of manually logging into the AWS Management Console and copying/pasting information, you can schedule an AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) script with an API call to pull this data for you. The AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them with scripts. The AWS CLI is open-source, and there are installers available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.Here is an example of running an API call against a service using the AWS CLI: 

You get this response:

```
{

"Reservations": [

{"Groups": [],

"Instances": [

{"AmiLaunchIndex": 0,
```

and so on.

### The AWS Software Development Kits
API calls to AWS can also be performed by executing code with programming languages. You can do this by using AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs are open-source and maintained by AWS for the most popular programming languages, such as C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application source code with AWS services. Let’s say the frontend of the application runs in Python and every time it receives a cat photo, it uploads that photo to a storage service. This action can be achieved from within the source code by using the AWS SDK for Python.

Here is an example of code you can implement to work with AWS resources using the Python AWS SDK.

```
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_instances()
print(response)
```

## Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model
When you begin working with the AWS Cloud, managing security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. To depict this shared responsibility, AWS created the shared responsibility model. This distinction of responsibility is commonly referred to as security of the cloud, versus security in the cloud.

![Shared Responsibility](Shared_Responsibility.png)

### What is AWS Responsible For?
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means AWS is required to protect and secure the infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for:

- Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings
- Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical server, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

The level of responsibility AWS has depends on the service. AWS classifies services into three different categories. The following table provides information about each, as well as the AWS responsibility.

| Category | Examples of AWS Services in the Category | AWS Responsibility |
|----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Infrastructure services | Compute services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) | AWS manages the underlying infrastructure and foundation services. |
| Container services | Services that require less management from the customer, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) | AWS manages the underlying infrastructure and foundation services, operating system, and application platform. |
| Abstracted services | Services that require very little management from the customer, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) | AWS operates the infrastructure layer, operating system, and platforms, as well as server-side encryption and data protection. |

**Note:** Container services refer to AWS abstracting application containers behind the scenes, not Docker container services. This enables AWS to move the responsibility of managing that platform away from customers.

### What is the Customer Respoinsible For?
You’re responsible for security in the cloud. When using any AWS service, you’re responsible for properly configuring the service and your applications, as well as ensuring your data is secure. The level of responsibility you have depends on the AWS service. Some services require you to perform all the necessary security configuration and management tasks, while other more abstracted services require you to only manage the data and control access to your resources. Using the three categories of AWS services, you can determine your level of responsibility for each AWS service you use.

| Category | AWS Responsibility | Customer Responsibility |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Infrastructure services | AWS manages the infrastructure and foundation services. | You control the operating system and application platform, as well as encrypting, protecting, and managing customer data. |
| Container services | AWS manages the infrastructure and foundation services, operating system, and application platform. | You are responsible for customer data, encrypting that data, and protecting it through network firewalls and backups. |
| Abstracted services | AWS operates the infrastructure layer, operating system, and platforms, as well as server-side encryption and data protection. | You are responsible for managing customer data and protecting it through client-side encryption. |


Due to the varying level of effort, it’s important to consider which AWS service you use and review the level of responsibility required to secure the service. It’s also important to review how the shared security model aligns with the security standards in your IT environment, as well as any applicable laws and regulations. It’s important to note that you maintain complete control of your data and are responsible for managing the security related to your content. Here are some examples of your responsibilities in context.

- Choosing a Region for AWS resources in accordance with data sovereignty regulations
- Implementing data protection mechanisms, such as encryption and managing backups
- Using access control to limit who has access to your data and AWS resources

## Protect the AWS Root User
### What’s the Big Deal About Auth?
When you’re configuring access to any account, two terms come up frequently: authentication and authorization. Though these terms may seem basic, you need to understand them to properly configure access management on AWS. It’s important to keep this mind as you progress in this course. Let’s define both terms.

### Understand Authentication
When you create your AWS account, you use a combination of an email address and a password to verify your identity. If the user types in the correct email and password, the system assumes the user is allowed to enter and grants them access. This is the process of *authentication*. Authentication ensures that the user is who they say they are. Usernames and passwords are the most common types of authentication, but you may also work with other forms, such as token-based authentication or biometric data like a fingerprint. **Authentication simply answers the question, “Are you who you say you are?”**

### Understand Authorization
Once you’re inside your AWS account, you might be curious about what actions you can take. This is where *authorization* comes in. Authorization is the process of giving users permission to access AWS resources and services. Authorization determines whether the user can perform an action—whether it be to read, edit, delete, or create resources. **Authorization answers the question, “What actions can you perform?”**

### Understand the AWS Root User Credentials
The AWS root user has two sets of credentials associated with it. One set of credentials is the email address and password used to create the account. This allows you to access the AWS Management Console. The second set of credentials is called access keys, which allow you to make programmatic requests from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API. Access keys consist of two parts:

- An access key ID, for example, A2lAl5EXAMPLE
- A secret access key, for example, wJalrFE/KbEKxE

Similar to a username and password combination, you need both the access key ID and secret access key to authenticate your requests via the AWS CLI or AWS API. Access keys should be managed with the same security as an email address and password.

### Follow Best Practices When Working with the AWS Root User
Keep in mind that the root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources in your account, as well as your billing and personal information. Due to this, securely lock away the credentials associated with the root user and do not use the root user for everyday tasks.  To ensure the safety of the root user:

- Choose a strong password for the root user.
- Never share your root user password or access keys with anyone.
- Disable or delete the access keys associated with the root user.
- Do not use the root user for administrative tasks or everyday tasks.

When is it OK to use the AWS root user? There are some tasks where it makes sense to use the AWS root user. Check out the links at the end of this section to read about them.

### The Case for Multi-Factor Authentication
When you create an AWS account and first log in to that account, you use single-factor authentication. Single-factor authentication is the simplest and most common form of authentication. It only requires one authentication method. In this case, you use a username and password to authenticate as the AWS root user. Other forms of single-factor authentication include a security pin or a security token. However, sometimes a user’s password is easy to guess. 

For example, your coworker Bob’s password, IloveCats222, might be easy for someone who knows Bob personally to guess, because it’s a combination of information that is easy to remember and describes certain things about Bob (1. Bob loves cats, and 2. Bob’s birthday is February 22). If a bad actor guessed or cracked Bob’s password through social engineering, bots, or scripts, Bob might lose control of his account. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario that users of any website often face.

This is why using MFA has become so important in preventing unwanted account access. MFA requires two or more authentication methods to verify an identity, pulling from three different categories of information.

- Something you know, such as a username and password, or pin number
- Something you have, such as a one-time passcode from a hardware device or mobile app
- Something you are, such as fingerprint or face scanning technology

Using a combination of this information enables systems to provide a layered approach to account access. Even though the first method of authentication, Bob’s password, was cracked by a malicious user, it’s very unlikely that a second method of authentication, such as a fingerprint, would also be cracked. This extra layer of security is needed when protecting your most sacred accounts, which is why it’s important to enable MFA on your AWS root user.

### Use MFA on AWS
If you enable MFA on your root user, you are required to present a piece of identifying information from both the something you know category and the something you have category. The first piece of identifying information the user enters is an email and password combination. The second piece of information is a temporary numeric code provided by an MFA device. Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security because it requires users to use a supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials. It’s best practice to enable MFA on the root user.

### Review Supported MFA Devices
AWS supports a variety of MFA mechanisms, such as virtual MFA devices, hardware devices, and Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys. For instructions on how to set up each method, check out the Resources section.

| Device | Description | Supported Devices |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Virtual MFA | A software app that runs on a phone or other device that provides a one-time passcode. Keep in mind that these applications can run on unsecured mobile devices, and because of that, may not provide the same level of security as hardware or U2F devices. | Authy, Duo Mobile, LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator |
| Hardware | A hardware device, generally a key fob or display card device that generates a one-time six-digit numeric code | Key fob, display card |
| U2F | A hardware device that you plug into a USB port on your computer | YubiKey |

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
### What is IAM?
IAM is a web service that enables you to manage access to your AWS account and resources. It also provides a centralized view of who and what are allowed inside your AWS account (authentication), and who and what have permissions to use and work with your AWS resources (authorization). With IAM, you can share access to an AWS account and resources without having to share your set of access keys or password. You can also provide granular access to those working in your account, so that people and services only have permissions to the resources they need. For example, to provide a user of your AWS account with read-only access to a particular AWS service, you can granularly select which actions and which resources in that service they can access.

### Get to Know the IAM Features
To help control access and manage identities within your AWS account, IAM offers many features to ensure security.

- IAM is global and not specific to any one Region. This means you can see and use your IAM configurations from any Region in the AWS Management Console.
- IAM is integrated with many AWS services by default.
- You can establish password policies in IAM to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for users.
- IAM supports MFA.
- IAM supports identity federation, which allows users who already have passwords elsewhere—for example, in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider—to get temporary access to your AWS account.
- Any AWS customer can use IAM; the service is offered at no additional charge.

### What is an IAM User?
An IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS. You define the user within your AWS account. And any activity done by that user is billed to your account. Once you create a user, that user can sign in to gain access to the AWS resources inside your account. You can also add more users to your account as needed. For example, for your cat photo application, you could create individual users in your AWS account that correspond to the people who are working on your application. Each person should have their own login credentials. Providing users with their own login credentials prevents sharing of credentials.

### IAM User Credentials
An IAM user consists of a name and a set of credentials. When creating a user, you can choose to provide the user:

- Access to the AWS Management Console
- Programmatic access to the AWS CLI and AWS API

To access the AWS Management Console, provide the users with a user name and password. For programmatic access, AWS generates a set of access keys that can be used with the AWS CLI and AWS API. IAM user credentials are considered permanent, in that they stay with the user until there’s a forced rotation by admins. When you create an IAM user, you have the option to grant permissions directly at the user level. This can seem like a good idea if you have only one or a few users. However, as the number of users helping you build your solutions on AWS increases, it becomes more complicated to keep up with permissions. For example, if you have 3,000 users in your AWS account, administering access becomes challenging, and it’s impossible to get a top-level view of who can perform what actions on which resources. If only there were a way to group IAM users, you can attach permissions at the group level instead.

### IAM Groups
An IAM group is a collection of users. All users in the group inherit the permissions assigned to the group. This makes it easy to give permissions to multiple users at once. It’s a more convenient and scalable way of managing permissions for users in your AWS account. This is why using IAM groups is a best practice. If you have a an application that you’re trying to build and have multiple users in one account working on the application, you might decide to organize these users by job function. You might want IAM groups organized by developers, security, and admins. You would then place all of your IAM users in the respective group for their job function. This provides a better view to see who has what permissions within your organization and an easier way to scale as new people join, leave, and change roles in your organization. Consider the following examples.

- A new developer joins your AWS account to help with your application. You simply create a new user and add them to the developer group, without having to think about which permissions they need.
- A developer changes jobs and becomes a security engineer. Instead of editing the user’s permissions directly, you can instead remove them from the old group and add them to the new group that already has the correct level of access.

Keep in mind the following features of groups.

- Groups can have many users.
- Users can belong to many groups.
- Groups cannot belong to groups.

The root user can perform all actions on all resources inside an AWS account by default. This is in contrast to creating new IAM users, new groups, or new roles. New IAM identities can perform no actions inside your AWS account by default until you explicitly grant them permission. The way you grant permissions in IAM is by using IAM policies.

### IAM Policies
To manage access and provide permissions to AWS services and resources, you create IAM policies and attach them to IAM users, groups, and roles. Whenever a user or role makes a request, AWS evaluates the policies associated with them. For example, if you have a developer inside the developers group who makes a request to an AWS service, AWS evaluates any policies attached to the developers group and any policies attached to the developer user to determine if the request should be allowed or denied.

#### IAM Policy Examples
Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents with several policy elements. Take a look at the following example of what providing admin access through an IAM identity-based policy looks like.

```JSON
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{        
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "*",
          "Resource": "*"
     }]
}
```

In this policy, there are four major JSON elements: Version, Effect, Action, and Resource.

- The **Version** element defines the version of the policy language. It specifies the language syntax rules that are needed by AWS to process a policy. To use all the available policy features, include "Version": "2012-10-17" before the "Statement" element in all your policies.
- The **Effect** element specifies whether the statement will allow or deny access. In this policy, the Effect is "Allow", which means you’re providing access to a particular resource.
- The **Action** element describes the type of action that should be allowed or denied. In the above policy, the action is "*". This is called a wildcard, and it is used to symbolize every action inside your AWS account.
- The **Resource** element specifies the object or objects that the policy statement covers. In the policy example above, the resource is also the wildcard "*". This represents all resources inside your AWS console.

Putting all this information together, you have a policy that **allows** you to perform **all actions** on **all resources** inside your AWS account. This is what we refer to as an administrator policy.

Let’s look at another example of a more granular IAM policy.

```JSON
{"Version": "2012-10-17",    
     "Statement": [{
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [            
               "iam: ChangePassword",
               "iam: GetUser"
               ]
          "Resource":
"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"
     }]
}
```

After looking at the JSON, you can see that this policy **allows** the IAM user to **change their own IAM password** (iam:ChangePassword) and **get information about their own user** (iam:GetUser). It only permits them to access their own credentials because the resource restricts access with the variable substitution ${aws:username}.

### Understanding Policy Structure
When creating a policy, it is required to have each of the following elements inside a policy statement.

| Element | Description | Required | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| Effect | Specifies whether the statement results in an allow or an explicit deny | Yes | "Effect": "Deny" |
| Action | Describes the specific actions that will be allowed or denied | Yes | "Action": "iam:CreateUser" |
| Resource | Specifies the object or objects that the statement covers | Yes | "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-ID-without-hyphens:user/Bob" |

### IAM Roles (Role Based Access)
#### Lock Down the AWS Root User
The root user is an all-powerful and all-knowing identity within your AWS account. If a malicious user were to gain control of root-user credentials, they would be able to access every resource within your account, including personal and billing information. To lock down the root user:

- Don’t share the credentials associated with the root user.
- Consider deleting the root user access keys.
- Enable MFA on the root account.

#### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege
Least privilege is a standard security principle that advises you to grant only the necessary permissions to do a particular job and nothing more. To implement least privilege for access control, start with the minimum set of permissions in an IAM policy and then grant additional permissions as necessary for a user, group, or role.

#### Use IAM Appropriately
IAM is used to secure access to your AWS account and resources. It simply provides a way to create and manage users, groups and roles to access resources within a single AWS account. IAM is not used for website authentication and authorization, such as providing users of a website with sign-in and sign-up functionality. IAM also does not support security controls for protecting operating systems and networks.

#### Use IAM Roles When Possible
Maintaining roles is easier than maintaining users. When you assume a role, IAM dynamically provides temporary credentials that expire after a defined period of time, between 15 minutes and 36 hours. Users, on the other hand, have long-term credentials in the form of user name and password combinations or a set of access keys. User access keys only expire when you or the admin of your account rotates these keys. User login credentials expire if you have applied a password policy to your account that forces users to rotate their passwords.

#### Consider Using an Identity Provider
If you decide to make your cat photo application into a business and begin to have more than a handful of people working on it, consider managing employee identity information through an identity provider (IdP). Using an IdP, whether it be an AWS service such as AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On) or a third-party identity provider, provides you a single source of truth for all identities in your organization. You no longer have to create separate IAM users in AWS. You can instead use IAM roles to provide permissions to identities that are federated from your IdP. For example, you have an employee, Martha, that has access to multiple AWS accounts. Instead of creating and managing multiple IAM users named Martha in each of those AWS accounts, you can manage Martha in your company’s IdP. If Martha moves within the company or leaves the company, Martha can be updated in the IdP, rather than in every AWS account you have.

#### Consider AWS IAM Identity Center
If you have an organization that spans many employees and multiple AWS accounts, you may want your employees to sign in with a single credential. AWS IAM Identity Center is an IdP that lets your users sign in to a user portal with a single set of credentials. It then provides them access to all their assigned accounts and applications in one central location. AWS IAM Identity Center is similar to IAM, in that it offers a directory where you can create users, organize them in groups, set permissions across those groups, and grant access to AWS resources. However, AWS IAM Identity Center has some advantages over IAM. For example, if you’re using a third-party IdP, you can sync your users and groups to AWS IAM Identity Center. This removes the burden of having to re-create users that already exist elsewhere, and it enables you to manage those users from your IdP. More importantly, AWS IAM Identity Center separates the duties between your IdP and AWS, ensuring that your cloud access management is not inside or dependent on your IdP.

## Introduction to Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
### What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to provision virtual servers called EC2 instances. Although AWS uses the phrase “web service” to describe it, it doesn’t mean that you are limited to running just web servers on your EC2 instances. You can create and manage these instances through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), or through automation tools and infrastructure orchestration services.In order to create an EC2 instance, you need to define:

- Hardware specifications, like CPU, memory, network, and storage.
- Logical configurations, like networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice.

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

### What is an AMI?
In the traditional infrastructure world, the process of spinning up a server consists of installing an operating system from installation disks, installation drives, or installation wizards over the network. In the AWS Cloud, this operating system installation is no longer your responsibility, and is instead built into the AMI that you choose. Not only does an AMI let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.

### What is the Relationship Between AMIs and EC2 Instances?
EC2 instances are live instantiations of what is defined in an AMI, much like a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe. If you are familiar with software development, you can also see this kind of relationship between a Class and an Object.

A Class is something you model and define, while an object is something you interact with. In this case, the AMI is how you model and define your instance, while the EC2 instance is the entity you interact with, where you can install your web server, and serve your content to users. When you launch a new instance, AWS allocates a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. Then the AMI you selected is copied to the root device volume, which contains the image used to boot the volume. In the end, you get a server you can connect to and install packages and any additional software. In this case, you install a web server along with the properly configured source code of your employee directory app.

One advantage of using AMIs is that they are reusable. 

You might choose a Linux-based AMI and configure the HTTP server, application packages, and any additional software you may need to run your application.

If you wanted to create a second EC2 instance with the same configurations, how can you easily do that? One option is to go through the entire instance creation and configuration process and try to match your settings to the first instance. However, this is time consuming and leaves room for human error. The second, better option, is to create an AMI from your running instance and use this AMI to start a new instance. This way, your new instance will have all the same configurations as your current instance, because the configurations set in the AMIs are the same.

### Where Can You Find AMIs?
You can select an AMI from the following categories.

- Quick Start AMIs that are premade by AWS and allow you to get started quickly.
- AWS Marketplace AMIs that provide popular open source and commercial software from third-party vendors.
- Community AMIs that are provided by the AWS user community.
- My AMIs that are created from your EC2 instances.
- Build your own custom image with EC2 Image Builder.

Each AMI in the AWS Management Console has an AMI ID, which is prefixed by “ami-”, followed by a random hash of numbers and letters. These IDs are unique to each AWS region.

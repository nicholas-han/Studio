# README: Mathematics

This folder contains the organized notes of my past and current study of mathematical topics, including but not limited to analysis and calculus, algebra and linear algebra, probability and stochastic calculus, and differential equations. Contributions to this folder include those from my undergraduate study, graduate study, online courses, as well as non-confidential, generic takeaways from my past working experiences.

These materials might not be suitable for all first-time learners, but serve as a good comprehensive review of certain topics provided that you have had past experience studying or using these knowledge.

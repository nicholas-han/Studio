# SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a major programming language in the database development field.

The biggest difference between SQL and other common programming languages, such as Java and Python is in the language design logic. The syntax of SQL focuses on the logic of grouping, while most other programming languages focus more on procedure, which uses linear thinking.

There are five Categories of SQL Commands

1. Data Definition Language (DDL): CREAT/DROP/ALTER/TRUNCATE
2. Data Query Language (DQL): SELECT
3. Data Manipulation Language (DML): INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CALL LOCK
4. Data Control Language (DCL): GRANT/REVOKE
5. Transaction Control Language (TCL): COMMIT/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/SET TRANSACTION/SET CONSTRAINT
